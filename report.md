1. Methodology & Initial Results

- Dataset creation approach and baseline model selection
    - I did an initial research with claude on how to create a synthetic data as well as pitfalls to avoid.
    - I had an idea of query expansion, i.e., expand business description in case its too short and not very descriptive.
    - Thinking about subdomain, but assuming since its just domain, so we should be ok.

- Initial model performance and evaluation metrics 
    - Evaluation framework:  I generate the a score that includes both rules based evaluation and llm evaluation. Both of these weigh 50% for the overall score. This is so that we can compare fine tuned model performance with baseline evaluation dataset.
        - Rule based evaluation: These are simple evaluations that could be used to evaluate domains from various angles. These are listed below:
                - Instersection between business description and the domain names
                - Length of the domain name, rewarding a score if it's between 6 and 15
                - Rewarding if the end of the domain are common such as `.com`, `.net`, and `.org`.
                - Rewarding a score of the domain does not include numbers and hyphens.
        
        - LLM based evaluation: I use openai to evaluate domains given a busiess description based on relevance, memorability, brandability. The overall score ranges from 1 to 10.
        
        - Embedding based evaluation (unused): This is a very similar as LLM based evaluation. Basiacally instead of prompt engineering, I would get embedding of all domains and business description. Then I would calculate the cosine similarity for each domain's vector with the business description's vector. Again, the idea is the same as the previous one, so I ended up not using this.

    - Baseline metric, i.e., I calculated the score on 100 evaluation dataset. This dataset has both input (business description), and output (list of suggested domains). I modified rule based evalution for this because we know what edge cases are, i.e., when the empty list is predicted for inappropriate request, I would reward it by giving it a higher score. The score ranges from 0 to 1 and the average score was 0.55 for the evaluation dataset. This would act as a benchmark for future fine-tuned models.
        
    - The intial model performance was encouraging in that it started generating the domains correctly (as per the quality of training dataset). This was a very good start. It gave me a confidence that increasing data quality will increse the performance of the fine-tuned model. See below for more quantitative analysis on model performance.
        - which is a combined score of rule based evaluation and llm evaluation. The maximum score is 1.
    - Fine tuned metric
        - The average score was 0.54 which is as good as the eval dataset/ground truth. The score is based on both llm as a judge and rule based evaluation.
        -Alert: The data on eval dataset is randomly generated as the training dataset. There is a chance of overfitting.


2. Edge Case Analysis
- Discovery process: How you found edge cases
    - First few results
        - duplicate domain problems
        - failure on simple deviation from the dataset (presenting a big issue with data quality)
            - ex: if business description looking for explicit activities
    - Edge case discovery for inappropriate content by openai (as per https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation)
        - None detected on the evaluation dataset
- Failure taxonomy: Categories of failures with examples
    - 
- Frequency analysis: How common each failure type is
    - 
    ```
        {
            "total_cases": 4,
            "by_failure_type": {
                "format_error": 3,
                "safety_issue": 1
            },

                "adult_content": 1

                "Add to training data": 4
            },
            "root_causes": {
                "Invalid domains found in the response": 3,
                "Content flagged by OpenAI moderation": 1
            }
        }
    ```


3. Iterative Improvement
- Improvement strategies: What you tried and why
    - The edge case analysis pointed out that the evaluation strategy during edge case analysis is incorrectly picking up empty domains for inappropriate content. I also found that the model does not have a good handle on voilent data. Thus, given time contraint (which I gave myself), I went ahead to  improved on only type of data, violence. I added 80 new data points to that are violent in nature. I used chatgpt to generate some violent data which was tricky because chatgpt would not explictly synthetically generate data with violence in it. I trained on the previous fine tuned model due to time contraints.

- Quantified results: Before/after metrics for each iteration
    - The results for different models are given below. The score ranged from 0 to 1. The baseline metric is evaluation data (not a predicted) and I calculated a score on it so that I could compare other models on it. Note: Yes, ideally the evaluation data metric should be around 0.97. This is a place where we could work to make the both data evaluation framework as well as the data quality better.

        - We could see that the final model with 5080 training data points is performant, however I found out that it unlearned generating the domains in some cases. Thus, (1) the evaluation framework should be improved and (2) add variety of samples in the new training set to ensure it does not unlearn basic task of generating domains.

4. Model Comparison & Recommendations
• Performance comparison: Statistical significance of improvements
- Production readiness: Which version you'd deploy and why
    - For this assignment, I would deploy first fine tuned model. The reason being for the latter model, the performance to generate the good quality domains degraded. See below for "organic coffee shop in downtown area."
