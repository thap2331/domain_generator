1. Methodology & Initial Results

- Dataset creation approach and baseline model selection
    - I did an initial research with claude on how to create a synthetic data as well as pitfalls to avoid.
    - I had an idea of query expansion, i.e., expand business description in case its too short and not very descriptive.
    - Thinking about subdomain, but assuming since its just domain, so we should be ok.

- Initial model performance and evaluation metrics
    - Baseline metric, i.e., on 100 eval dataset. This dataset has both input and output. I generate the scores that includes both rules based evaluation and llm evaluation. This is so that we can compare fine tuned model performance with baseline evaluation dataset.
        - The average score was 0.55 which is a combined score of rule based evaluation and llm evaluation. The maximum score is 1.
    - Fine tuned metric
        - The average score was 0.54 which is as good as the eval dataset/ground truth. The score is based on both llm as a judge and rule based evaluation.
        -Alert: The data on eval dataset is randomly generated as the training dataset. There is a chance of overfitting.


2. Edge Case Analysis
- Discovery process: How you found edge cases
    - First few results
        - duplicate domain problems
        - failure on simple deviation from the dataset (presenting a big issue with data quality)
            - ex: if business description looking for explicit activities
    - Edge case discovery for inappropriate content by openai (as per https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation)
        - None detected on the evaluation dataset
- Failure taxonomy: Categories of failures with examples
    - 
- Frequency analysis: How common each failure type is
    - 
    ```
        {
            "total_cases": 4,
            "by_failure_type": {
                "format_error": 3,
                "safety_issue": 1
            },
            "by_severity": {
                "HIGH": 4
            },
            "by_category": {
                "empty_input": 1,
                "long_input": 1,
                "weapons_business": 1,
                "adult_content": 1
            },
            "improvement_strategies": {
                "Add to training data": 4
            },
            "root_causes": {
                "Invalid domains found in the response": 3,
                "Content flagged by OpenAI moderation": 1
            }
        }
    ```


3. Iterative Improvement
- Improvement strategies: What you tried and why
    - The edge case analysis pointed out that the evaluation strategy during edge case analysis is incorrectly picking up empty domains for inappropriate content. I also found that the model does not have a good handle on voilent data. Thus, given time contraint (which I gave myself), I went ahead to  improved on only type of data, violence. I added 80 new data points to that are violent in nature. I used chatgpt to generate some violent data which was tricky because chatgpt would not explictly synthetically generate data with violence in it. I trained on the previous fine tuned model due to time contraints.

4. Model Comparison & Recommendations
• Performance comparison: Statistical significance of improvements
- Production readiness: Which version you'd deploy and why
    - For this assignment, I would deploy first fine tuned model. The reason being for the latter model, the performance to generate the good quality domains degraded. See below for "organic coffee shop in downtown area."
